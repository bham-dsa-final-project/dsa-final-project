Here we will outline the steps the CI/CD pipeline takes to build, test, and deploy the application. This will include the GitHub Actions workflows, environment setup, and deployment process.

ðŸ”§ CI/CD Pipeline Overview ðŸ”§
1. GitHub Actions Workflows:
   - Define CI/CD workflows in `.github/workflows/` directory.
   - Use YAML syntax to configure workflow steps.
   - Trigger workflows based on events (e.g., push, pull request).
2. Environment Setup:
    - Define environment variables for credentials and sensitive information.
    - Use GitHub Secrets to securely manage environment variables.
    - Install necessary tools and dependencies in the workflow.
3. Build Process:
    - Build using .jar file provided by the Java team.
    - Use Docker to containerize the application.
    - Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Amazon ECR).
4. Test Process:
    - Run automated tests against the application.
    - Use JUnit for unit testing and Selenium for end-to-end testing.
    - Notify the team of test results and failures.
5. Deployment Process:
    - Deploy the application to the staging environment.
    - Run integration tests against the staging environment.
    - If tests pass, deploy the application to the production environment.
6. Monitoring and Notifications:
    - Set up monitoring and alerting for key metrics.
    - Notify the team of build statuses and deployment results.
    - Use communication channels (e.g., Teams) for notifications.

ðŸš€ CI/CD Pipeline Steps ðŸš€
1. Build Workflow:
   - Checkout the source code from the GitHub repository.
   - Set up Java environment and dependencies.
   - Build the application using Maven.
   - Package the application into a .jar file.
   - Build the Docker image.
   - Push the Docker image to the container registry.
2. Test Workflow:
    - Set up testing environment.
    - Run unit tests using JUnit.
    - Run end-to-end tests using Selenium.
    - Notify the team of test results.
3. Deploy Workflow:
    - Deploy the application to the staging environment.
    - Run integration tests against the staging environment.
    - Deploy the application to the production environment.
    - Notify the team of deployment results.
4. Monitoring Workflow:
    - Set up monitoring and alerting for key metrics.
    - Notify the team of build statuses and deployment results.
    - Use communication channels (e.g., Teams) for notifications.

ðŸ“ˆ CI/CD Pipeline Metrics ðŸ“ˆ
1. Build Metrics:
   - Build success rate.
   - Build duration.
   - Number of failed builds.
2. Test Metrics:
    - Test success rate.
    - Test coverage.
    - Number of failed tests.

ðŸ”” CI/CD Pipeline Notifications ðŸ””
1. Build Notifications:
   - Notify the team of build status (success/failure).
   - Send notifications for failed builds.
2. Deployment Notifications:
    - Notify the team of deployment status (success/failure).
    - Send notifications for failed deployments.
3. Monitoring Notifications:
    - Alert the team of any critical issues.
    - Send notifications for high-priority alerts.

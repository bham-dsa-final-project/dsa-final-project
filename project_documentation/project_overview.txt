This is a comprehensive overview of our final project problem statement and the resources we will be using through the project.

üìÉ Problem Statement üìÉ
Currently, Version 1 has four systems in place on the intranet that are used by employees across the organisation. These are Talentguard, Call-Out, Small Improvements and Hall of Fame. These systems are not integrated with each other and are served as separate services.

The purpose of these services are as follows:
- Talentguard: Used for people's career development and recording of skills and competencies.
- Small Improvements: Used for quaterly reviews and feedback.
- Hall of Fame: Some teams have a Hall of Fame and use it to record completed certifications, give recognition and feedback, both internal and external and is currently managed in Teams. 
- Call-Out: Used to recognise people who have gone above and beyond in their work.

The pain points of each system are as follows:
- Talentguard: Very unintuitive and difficult to use. It is not user friendly and is not integrated with other systems. We are also unable to report on the data and is mostly self-reported.
- Small Improvements: The system is a few clicks away and is not immediately accessible.
- Hall of Fame: Skills/certifications are not centrally stored at organisation level, it is stored at practice level. 
- Call-Out: Doesn't record skills or certifications that have been achieved and we are also unable to report on this data. Data remains in the system and is not available centrally.

‚≠ê The goal of this project is to create a centralised system that integrates all four systems and is user friendly. This will allow us to report on the data and make it easier for employees to access the information they need. ‚≠ê

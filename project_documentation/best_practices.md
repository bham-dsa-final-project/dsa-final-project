Here we will be discussing the best pratices we followed when developing the project. 

📋 Project Management and Collaboration 📋

Utilize Trello and Miro Boards Effectively:

Trello Board:
Organize tasks into categories (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Completed).
Use labels for prioritization and assign tasks to team members.
Regularly update task statuses and ensure transparency.

Miro Board:
Create visual representations of workflows, user journeys, and architecture.
Use for brainstorming sessions and to collect feedback.
Share updates during team meetings to ensure alignment.

📂 Version Control and Code Management 📂

GitHub Repository Management:

Maintain a clean and structured repository. Use branches for features, bug fixes, and releases.

Use pull requests for code reviews. Ensure each PR is reviewed by at least one other team member.

Write meaningful commit messages to describe changes succinctly.

🏗️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform 🏗️

Terraform Best Practices:

Use modules to encapsulate reusable configurations.

Manage state files securely using remote backends (e.g., AWS S3 with state locking via DynamoDB).

Implement automated Terraform validation and formatting checks in CI/CD pipelines.

🌐 AWS Resource Management 🌐

AWS Best Practices:

Follow the principle of least privilege for IAM roles and policies.

Build in a loosely coupled manner.

🔄 CI/CD Pipeline 🔄

GitHub Actions for CI/CD:

Automate build, test, and deployment processes using GitHub Actions workflows.

Use environment secrets to securely manage credentials and sensitive information.

Notify the team of build statuses and deployment results via communication channels (e.g., Teams).

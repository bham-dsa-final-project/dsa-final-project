2. Install the necessary development tools and dependencies:
   - Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.
    - AWS CLI for managing AWS resources.
    - Docker for containerization.
    - Visual Studio Code for code editing.
3. Set up environment variables for AWS credentials and other sensitive information.
4. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform configuration.
5. Run `terraform plan` to review the planned changes.
6. Run `terraform apply` to provision the infrastructure on AWS.
